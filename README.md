# solidity-core-concepts
Concept-based Solidity exercises focused on secure smart contract development. Includes daily practice across core topics like state variables, functions, structs, mappings, modifiers, visibility, and gas optimization. Organized for clarity and long-term retention.

## What is Solidity?

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language used to build smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It’s statically typed, inspired by JavaScript and C++, and designed for secure, decentralized applications.

This repo breaks down Solidity into core concepts — each folder contains short examples focused on clarity and retention.
